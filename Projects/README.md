# My Initial Projects

This folder contains a collection of initial projects I worked on. Each project represented a unique challenge and learning opportunity, from simple games to implementing complex classes.

## Project Descriptions

- **Fraction.java**: Implements a `Fraction` class that supports arithmetic operations, reduction, and comparison between fractions.
- **GuessingGame.java**: A basic number guessing game that prompts the user to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 20.
- **GuessingGame2.java**: An extension of the initial guessing game with additional user prompts and input validation.
- **ItemToPurchase.java**: Defines an `ItemToPurchase` class for a shopping application, including methods for displaying item costs and descriptions.
- **LoopGuessingGame.java**: A guessing game that continues until the correct number is guessed, providing feedback on each guess about its accuracy.
- **LoopGuessingGameWarmCool.java**: An enhanced version of the guessing game, providing "warmer" or "colder" hints based on the previous guesses.
- **NoteGenerator.java**: Generates musical scales and chords, displaying them in various forms, useful for music theory applications.
- **PlayerRoster.java**: Manages a roster of players, including functions to update, add, or remove players based on their jersey numbers and ratings.
- **RollingDiceProject.java**: Simulates rolling a number of dice over multiple trials, providing statistical outcomes and visual histogram representation.
- **ShoppingCart.java**: Implements a shopping cart where items can be added, removed, or modified, and displays the total cost.
- **ShoppingCartManager.java**: Manages the shopping cart, allowing the user to interact with the cart through a console menu.
- **SquareRoot.java**: Represents and manipulates square roots, providing methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and simplification.
