# Recursion Folder

This folder contains Java programs that implement recursion to solve various problems, demonstrating the recursive approach in programming.

## Program Descriptions

- **Countdown.java**: Implements a countdown from a user-specified number to zero using recursion, ending with the message "Blastoff!".
- **Countup.java**: Performs a count from zero to a user-specified number using recursion, also ending with "Blastoff!".
- **EvenSum.java**: Calculates the sum of all even numbers up to a given number using recursion.
- **Factorial.java**: Computes the factorial of a given number recursively, displaying the result.
- **Fibonacci.java**: Calculates the nth Fibonacci number using a recursive method.
- **ImprimirLineas.java**: Displays a specified number of newline characters using recursion, illustrating simple repetitive action.
- **Mult.java**: Recursively multiplies two numbers by adding the first number to itself, the second number of times.
- **OddSum.java**: Computes the sum of all odd numbers up to a given number using recursion.
- **Power.java**: Recursively calculates the power of a base raised to an exponent.
- **Sum.java**: Recursively calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to a specified number.
