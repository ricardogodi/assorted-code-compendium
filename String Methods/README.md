# String Methods Folder

This folder contains a set of Java programs that focus on various string manipulation techniques, illustrating practical applications of string methods in programming.

## Program Descriptions

- **CharDemo.java**: Prints the ASCII table and checks if a character is an upper case, lower case, or not a letter.
- **ComparingStrings.java**: Demonstrates methods to compare strings such as `equals`, `equalsIgnoreCase`, and `compareTo`.
- **ExamPractice1.java**: Checks the type of web domain (commercial, organizational, or educational) based on the URL entered.
- **MoreStringMethods.java**: Provides functions for determining if strings are palindromes, if two strings are anagrams, and if one string can be formed from the characters of another.
- **MoreStringMethods2.java**: Similar to `MoreStringMethods`, focuses on counting the frequency of each character in a string and displays the counts.
- **StringMethods.java**: Includes methods for reversing strings, extracting last names and first names from a string, counting non-whitespace characters, and counting words.
- **TestingStringEquality.java**: Examines the difference between using `==` and `.equals()` for string comparison.
- **TextMsgExpander.java** & **TextMsgExpander2.java**: Replace text message abbreviations like "IDK" with their full phrases ("I don't know").
- **ValidatePassword.java**: Confirms whether two entered passwords match.
- **ValidateUsernameAndPass.java**: Checks if the re-entered password matches the original during a username and password validation process.

These programs highlight essential string operations in Java, showcasing the necessity of string manipulation in programming.
