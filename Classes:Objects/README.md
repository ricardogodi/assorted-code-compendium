# Classes and Objects in Java

This repository section contains Java programs that demonstrate the use of classes and objects through various practical applications. These range from basic data handling to complex system simulations, showcasing object-oriented programming principles.

## Program Descriptions

- **Accumulator.java**: Manages a running total and count to compute averages, demonstrating encapsulation and basic class functionality.
- **Address.java**: Represents an address, illustrating how to use classes to encapsulate related data.
- **BankAccount.java**: Models a bank account, demonstrating methods for deposits and withdrawals along with basic account management.
- **BasicTV.java**: Simulates a television's operations like changing channels and turning power on and off, emphasizing state management within an object.
- **BasicTVClient.java**: Client class to test and demonstrate the functionalities of the BasicTV class.
- **Big.java**: Utilizes BigInteger for computations that exceed standard data type limits, such as calculating large factorials.
- **Bird.java**: Extends a generic Pet class, demonstrating inheritance and method overriding by adding unique behaviors.
- **Book.java**: Manages book information, showing how to handle multiple data fields and implement comparison logic.
- **Circle.java**: Uses class methods to perform various geometric calculations related to circles, demonstrating the practical application of class design principles.
- **Club.java**: Represents a club where membership can be tracked, demonstrating simple use of classes in managing group data.
- **Dog.java**: Another subclass of Pet, focusing on specific behaviors and demonstrating polymorphism.
- **Pet.java** and **Pet 2.java**: Base classes that introduce fundamental concepts of creating reusable and extendable classes.
- **PetClient.java**: Tests various subclasses of Pet, showing polymorphism and the use of arrays of objects.
- **Rectangle.java** and **Rectangle 2.java**: Deals with rectangles, calculating area and perimeter, and showing how to apply inheritance and interface implementation.
- **Rock.java** and **Rock 2.java**: Fun examples of subclassing Pet to add minimal or no behavior, used to illustrate inheritance and method overriding.
- **SavingsAccount.java**: Extends BankAccount to add interest processing, demonstrating inheritance and use of superclass methods.
- **ShapeInterface.java**: Defines an interface for geometric shapes, ensuring all implementing classes provide specific methods, illustrating the use of interfaces.
- **Sprite.java** and **SpriteDemo.java**: Complex examples of using classes to manage game entities with attributes like health and position.
- **Square.java**: A specific type of rectangle demonstrating inheritance and constructor overloading.
- **Student.java**: Complex class incorporating other classes (Name, Address), demonstrating deep integration of multiple classes.
- **Time.java** and **Time 2.java**: Manage time data, offering methods for time addition and checks, showing how to encapsulate time logic within a class.
- **Toggle.java**: Represents a boolean state that can be toggled, a simple example of encapsulating state.
- **Widget.java**: Demonstrates both instance and static methods and properties, highlighting differences between them.
