# Basic Programming Constructs in Java

This section of the repository contains Java programs that focus on basic programming constructs such as conditionals, loops, simple input/output operations, function calls, and the use of void methods. These programs are foundational for understanding how to manipulate data, control program flow, and structure basic methods in Java.

## Program Descriptions

- **BooleanPractice.java**: Demonstrates basic Boolean logic operations including conjunction, disjunction, and negation, utilizing function calls.
- **DrawHalfArrow.java**: Generates a half-arrow shape using user-specified dimensions, demonstrating loops and conditional logic.
- **MultiplyingTables.java**: Displays multiplication tables up to a user-defined size, illustrating loops and formatted output.
- **ScannerBug.java**: Showcases a common issue with Java's Scanner class when mixing `nextLine` with other `next` methods, and handling input properly.
- **ShootingPar.java**: Simple conditional structure to determine if a golf score is under, over, or exactly par.
- **Stars.java**: Prints a vertical series of stars, with each line containing one more star than the last, showing nested loops and method calls.
- **StarsNested.java**: Uses nested loops to print a square block of stars, using simple repetitive calls.
- **Sword.java**: Prints a sword pattern using stars, demonstrating methods with loops for repeating patterns and void methods.
- **ThisClassHasFourMethods.java**: Contains various small methods demonstrating the basic use of void methods in Java, including function calls for greetings and small talk.
- **VoidDemo.java**: Demonstrates the use of a void method to calculate the distance between two points in a Cartesian plane, including proper function calls and parameter passing.
- **VoidDemo2.java**: Includes methods to print various statements about awesomeness and statistical data, showing method overloading, formatted output, and recursion in void methods.
