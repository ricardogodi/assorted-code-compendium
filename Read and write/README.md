# Read and Write Folder

This folder contains Java programs that handle file I/O operations, demonstrating how to read from and write to files in Java.

## Program Descriptions

- **ReadAndWrite.java**: This program reads text from a file named "input.txt", reverses the content, and writes the reversed text to "output.txt". It uses `try` and `catch` blocks to handle potential `FileNotFoundException` and other exceptions, ensuring robust file handling.

- **ReadFiles.java**: Reads integers from a file specified by the user, calculates their sum, counts them, and computes the mean. It uses a `Scanner` object to parse the file and handles `IOException` to manage potential input/output errors.
