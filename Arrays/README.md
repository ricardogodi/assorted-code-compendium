# Array Manipulations in Java

This section contains Java programs that illustrate the use of arrays through various applications. These applications range from basic data accumulation to more complex file manipulations and sorting algorithms, all employing arrays.

## Program Descriptions

- **ArrayListAccumulator.java**: Manages a list of numbers to compute totals, averages, and find maximum and minimum values using an ArrayList.
- **ArrayListAccumulatorClient.java**: Driver class for ArrayListAccumulator that generates random numbers within specified limits and utilizes the accumulator for calculations.
- **CompileGrades.java**: Analyzes grade distribution from a file and displays grades along with their frequencies as stars.
- **CompileGradesRevised.java**: Improved version of CompileGrades using arrays to manage grade distribution and calculate average more efficiently.
- **CounterArray.java**: Simulates dice rolls and counts the frequency of each outcome using an array.
- **ExamPractice2.java**: Calculates and displays the mean and deviations for a set of data points entered by the user.
- **MultidimensionalArray.java**: Demonstrates operations on multi-dimensional arrays including random filling, printing, and statistics computations.
- **RandomizedAndSortNames.java**: Reads names from a file, randomizes their order, and then sorts them before writing to another file.
- **SearchNames.java**: Implements both sequential and binary search on a sorted array of names to find a specific target name.
- **TraverseCount.java**: Generates random scores, categorizes them into grade ranges, and counts the occurrences within each range.
- **TwoDimensionalArrayMethods.java**: Placeholder for methods operating on two-dimensional arrays (details not fully provided).
